				<p>
						Once a student is registered with us we consider ourselves to have a duty of care towards them. This means that we will offer what support and assistance we reasonably can if we are aware that they are having difficulties. However not all students are good at coming forward and asking for help and may need encouragement to do so. <br><br>
						If you are concerned about your son or daughter while they are a student here at the Institute, usually the best first step is to talk to them about the difficulties they are having and encourage them to speak to someone at the Institute.<br><br>
						 They can talk to their class tutor(s), a lecturer that they feel comfortable with in their academic department(s), to a fellow student, to someone in the Student Support Services or to someone in the Students’ Union.<br> You can find out more information about the different services from the Student Handbook or here:
						<a href="http://www.ittralee.ie/en/InformationFor/CurrentStudents/StudentLife/StudentServices/"> Find out more </a><br><br>
						If that doesn't work, or you feel the situation is very serious or urgent, then you have the option of contacting the college yourself, you can talk to the school, to the school’s administrator or perhaps the Institute Chaplain or the Institute Student Health Centre Nurse or Doctor in Student Support Services. Due to confidentiality or Data Protection, we will not be able to have a discussion with you or give you any information about your son or daughter. <br><br>
						However, we will be able to listen to you, take note of your concerns and alert those at the Institute with pastoral responsibility towards your son or daughter that may be able to help.<br><br>
						We cannot guarantee to offer you confidentiality as our duty of care is to the student, but we will take into account your preferences about whether we let your son or daughter know you have been in touch when deciding how best to proceed.
